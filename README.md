# What is this?
First and foremost The Fools Journey serves as a Python project for me to really cut my teeth on.

Beyond that, The Fools Journey Project aims to make learning Tarot easier and more hands-on, literally. The intended use is the user pulls a few cards in real life and then selects the same cards in the app to access meanings there. The problem this is trying to solve is endless scrolling to card interpretations on Tarot sites. 

## Tarot Snobbery
Look, this may come as a surprise to you; but my mom is crazy and insisted we be reaised heathens which occasionally meant engaging in paganism and whitchcraft. Therefore I was gifted my first deck around 13. Okay? What I am really saying is - I did it before it was cool. 

Therefore, all my interpretations are based on (or straight copied) from Jodorowsky and Costa. Out of all the Tarot books I have read; Jodorowsky's is by far the best. 

## Fools Journey Notes
- I am using Git as a tool to help me write this. Judge me all you want on the half-baked items I am committing.
- Until further notice this is a WIP. This is the first project I have tackled on my own that doesn't completely suck (well, we will see about that ha).
- I am a dork.
